      The laws in the UAE are quite different to the laws in other countries.
      The legal system in the UAE is a mix of Sharia Law (Islamic Law) and Conventional Law.
      Due to this fact, the laws of the UAE are very conservative, especially when compared
      with Western countries. <br> <br> In the UAE, clothing has to cover most of the body, and cannot
      be indecently exposing parts of the body. Also, clothing cannot be transparent. Similarily,
      rules on public behavior are very strict as well. In the UAE, public displays of affection are illegal
      and can result in imprisonment. Public behavior is expected to be respectful. <br> <br>
      Rules on alcohol are also very strict. To buy liquor, a special license is required. The license
      can only be obtained by Non-Muslim UAE Residents. Driving while drinking is illegal and will
      result in imprisonment. The legal age for drinking within the UAE is 21 years old. Rules on smoking are
      strict as well. Smoking is banned in public places such as malls, but there are designated areas for smoking.
      <br> <br> Overall, the rules in the UAE are much more strict when compared to other countries and therefore,
      a lot of attention needs to be directed towards obeying the laws in the UAE.
